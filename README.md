# Sudoku Solver

This Python file contains a program that can solve any Sudoku puzzle. The program uses a backtracking algorithm to find the solution to the given puzzle.

## How to Use
1. Open the file in a Python interpreter or run it from the command line.
2. Enter the Sudoku puzzle you want to solve. The puzzle should be entered as a 9x9 grid, with 0s representing empty cells.
3. The program will solve the puzzle and display the solution.

## Algorithm
The program uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle. It starts by finding an empty cell and trying all possible values for that cell. If a value is valid, it moves on to the next empty cell and repeats the process. If no valid value is found for an empty cell, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different value. This process continues until the puzzle is solved.
